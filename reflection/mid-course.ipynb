    "I chose to focus on Implementation and Experimentation. For Implementation, I learned many python toolkits to visualize, organize, and process data. Although I could not memorize them, I have practiced how to use them and know how to find them when needed. I also learned effective coding from my peers during warm-up discussions. However, for review purposes, I think maybe it is useful to organize a chart to jog down what kind of packages are used for what. For Experimentation, I focused on assessing the performance of various algorithms in blog post assignments. For example, I chose the Penguin blog post over the theoretical one and did optional work such as fitting with multiple algorithms and testing their accuracy. In terms of communicating the results, I explored data visualization that is not mentioned in our lectures, such as the pair plot to investigate the correlations between pairs of variables. "

    "The one goal that I don't think I could be on track is proposing and completing an additional blog post on an algorithm related to deep learning in bioinformatics, preferably psychiatric genetics. Due to huge size of genomic data and a lack of understanding to the domain knowledge (hundreds or thousands of individual genomic data would be around 500 GB; not sure how we could do anything interesting with summary statistics), I also decided not to do my project on psychiatric genetics. It is unfortunate that I could not use this class to explore my interest in this field in terms of the blog post and the project. To compensate, I might invest some time in researching and implementing related algorithms, but this might not be a priority and only a plus due to the workload I have."
